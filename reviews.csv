Becca C,8/14/2020,5 ,21,212,LOV is such an amazing vegan restaurant!!  Everything I've had to eat there has been incredible. I came across LOV watching a buzzfeed video which highlighted the kimchi fries which are good but not the best dish there. I was really excited when they opened a location in Toronto!  They've done a really great job with the decor. Even the bathrooms are really cute with fun wallpaper!  At first it was impossible to get a reservation but it seems to have settled down a little. They have a cute patio now too which wraps around to the back of the restaurant!Because of covid they have dividers between the tables inside are using paper menus and have reduced the menu pretty significantly but everything is still great!  The only thing I miss is the wedge salad.
Celine D,9/3/2020,4 ,86,23,"I LOV vegan restaurants! I've wanted to visit this chain since I heard about the location in Montreal . From previous reviews I knew the menu would be limited but I was a little bit disappointed by the options! I've been to many vegan places in Toronto and this one was just mediocre for me in terms of taste and plating. The interior is pretty there are plastic dividers between tables inside and a pretty packed patio. There was only 1 dessert option an $8 brownie so we went somewhere else for dessert. My french fries were very good burger was just okay. The cheese I felt did not add any flavour to it. I also ordered the ""Look of Lov"" cocktail which isn't pictured but it was very good I was hesitant about aquafaba being an ingredient but the foam on top added some texture that I didn't expect almost like an alcoholic latte! Overall I don't think I will be visiting Lov again but it was a cute place to check out and King Street West is always very lively!"
Isabelle W,8/6/2020,5 ,58,98,Everything about this restaurant is so cute down to the food the seating the little screen dividers that look like little windows.. to the bathroom!Ive never been keen on trying vegan food but this restaurant brought me here and I actually loved what I ate.I tried the coconut curry and it was quite flavorful. I like that there was different textures and it wasnt just a puree of veggies. There was different colours textures tastes.. that all meshed together to keep it interesting. I actually really like the added touch of the cashews inside. The waiter was very attentive and very personable.. he was interactive but wasnt in your face. He is great at what he does and really added to the overall experience! Would love to come back and try more items on the menu.
Sonia C,9/20/2020,4 ,128,139,The interior is beautiful and that's what drew me to try this restaurant and it was gorgeous indeed. Totally my aesthetic with an abundance of plants and cute trendy decor. I think the starters were better than the mains. We had beet tare tare and Brussel sprouts. The Brussel sprouts was probably the best I've had anywhere! Usually Brussel sprouts are just pan fried with some oil and garlic but they made it with an addictive orangey savoury sweet tangy sauce! It's hard not to burn Brussel sprouts but they weren't burnt here. My husband didn't really enjoy the burger though because he said it didn't taste like a real burger. I tried the patty and it did taste more like mushrooms but it's vegan so I didn't mind it!
Jenn W,5/29/2020,3 ,13,109,Pre-Covid review: Somehow two orders of fries end up at the table. The LOV poutine ($11) looks great smothered with plenty of miso gravy and vegan mozzarella but tastes like fries covered with a flavourless thick sauce. Stick with the kimchi fries ($8) instead which at least has the fermented cabbage and a creamy sesame dressing for interest.Perhaps an order of Brussel sprouts ($9) to keep everything healthy? They're deep fried and smothered with way too much of that tangy buffalo sauce.  And then the Zen salad ($16) arrives and the guilt momentarily washes away. It's a tasty combination of konjac noodles shredded vegetables (cabbage lettuce daikon carrots) and the extras thrown in for flavour and contrast (chilis and cashew). Maybe healthier options are better at LOV as this was the best of the starters. I thoroughly enjoyed the refreshing cilantro and mint elements. What? Am I a secret healthy eater?Then I take a bite of the mushroom risotto ($19) and taste my favourite dish of the night. Done traditionally the creamy rice and peas would have been good but is made even better with the roasted oyster mushrooms. Okay so perhaps I haven't turned into nutritionist.Yet the LOV lasagna ($19) didn't really excite. While the pasta looked delicious smothered with the vegan mozzarella and cashew cream it tasted bland. The best part of the plate was perhaps the Caesar salad.The gnocchi di casa ($20) was an interesting take on the classic Italian dish except at LOV it's made with sweet potato and buckwheat so there's antioxidant and fibre strewn throughout the dish. The sweetness did help balance the hemp basil and arugula pesto which by itself could have been too strong.Aside from the risotto it's the coconut curry ($18) that impressed. Who would have thought cubes of squash and carrots with a blanched kale could be so delicious when smothered in a cashew and coconut milk curry?
Jasmine L,3/21/2020,4 ,84,405,Slow service on a Saturday night but great atmosphere and take on vegan food! I would definitely come back again to try more :) We ordered the appetizers:-Dumplings (4/5): golden crispy on the outside with hot and savoury mushroom filling on the inside!-Mac &amp; Cheese (2/5): quite flavourless overall and the macaroni noodles were interestingly long We also tried the following main dishes:-Truffles &amp; Caviar (4/5): great option for us low-carb foodies because of the plentiful zucchini noodles drenched with a thinner type of sauce and not overly salty. I loved the savoury tapioca pearls and deliciously executed oyster mushrooms!! -Mushroom Risotto (4/5): definitely the heavier option and honestly so surprising that this is vegan! It's so creamy &amp; rich. I was also in LOV with the oyster mushrooms &amp; peas of this dish!Lastly for dessert we had:-Chocolate Carmelita (4/5): I'm a fan of all the textures in this sweet indulgent dessert! From the unmelted chocolate chips caramel raspberry purée &amp; coconut shreds ?
Lucky M,2/2/2020,4 ,6,20,I heard about this vegan place previously but the other location is a bit far for me. They recently opened one on king which is pretty close for me so I decided to try the brunch there.As everyone else said this place looks stunning - bright and white hanging plants nice wall paper - very instagram worthy I think.We were too lazy to make a reservation and not surprisingly the wait time for 2 would be 30 minutes for a table. However we did not need to wait as we agreed to sit at the bar. We had Apple Pancake. The pancake tastes quite crispy and nice especially there is no milk or egg added. I was never a huge fan of the vegan pastries but I like this pancake better than the regular ones. However there is no real side other than small amounts of strawberries or blueberries on top. It could be a bit too sweet to eat alone for breakfast or brunch.We also had Tofu Benedict. I had other veggie Benedict (Spanish or tomato) before but never really liked it. However this fried tofu goes really well with English muffin and hollandaise sauce. We all enjoyed this dish.The coffee and cocktail here are pretty good too. I think it has the potential to become my favourite vegan brunch. I think I will go back there again in the future.
Tina H,1/25/2020,5 ,70,612,I found out about this place initially from walking by. It looks beautiful. I looked it up and learned it was a vegan restaurant. wat? Definitely doesn't look like one. Ok though!The decor is beautiful. Bright and white inside. Very vast. Hanging plants. White antique windows and doors lined the ceiling. Marble (?) tables. Very beautiful.There were 3 of us and we decided to get a bunch of apps and 2 of us split wine. They were able to accommodate gluten-free and a nut allergy. The arancini balls with rice and fake cheddar in tomato sauce were delicious. It was quite savoury and rich. The onion rings with aioli were also very delicious. The dairy alternatives appear to be soy-based FYI but they had some cashew-based things. We didn't get any with cashew. The dumplings were pretty light and savoury and the sauce was spicy and savoury. Brussels sprouts were delicious. I hear the fritters were good but I didn't try those. The wine we had was an Italian Pinot Grigio and it was light and crisp very delicious.My only feedback would be to incorporate some dessert options that were not only soy-based fake dairy. There's a lot you can do with fruits alone like sorbets and other things but their only options were cheesecake and ice cream with soy milk. Thankfully I was stuffed from dinner so I didn't want any dessert. Everything was very good value. It was around $55 before tip for splitting a bunch of apps and a bottle of wine and I was full and satisfied. Our waitress was absolutely lovely. Very friendly and attentive and made great and honest recommendations. Everything seemed timed really perfectly and I really liked the seat we got. This place is delicious and good value if you're in a group and can split stuff. I would recommend trying it out for sure.
Sarah S,1/4/2020,5 ,200,509,On the outside LOV boasts large windows with some foliage and of course even more foliage as you step inside. You are greeted with ceiling plants and tapestry as you step in. The restaurant feels very inviting and I imagine it would be more so for those who are vegan/vegetarian. We had the mushroom dumplings mushroom risotto Big LOV cheeseburger blue lavender latte and immunity shot. Everything was delicious. The mushroom risotto was somewhat salty but was still tasty. It was surprisingly filling as well! In fact we were barely able to move after our dinner! The immunity shot as you can imagine was hard to drink at first - my bad for making the rookie mistake of doing just the one sip and then continuing the rest (I wanted my bf to try some too) - but you do feel great after. It also helped to cleanse everything that you've eaten previously. I will definitely be coming back - with all of the greenery and the green foods this place would be perfect for brunch during spring!
Freyhan D,2/12/2020,4 ,84,143,"Located in a prime spot downtown around a ton clubs etc this is a great convenient spot for vegans to get some hearty meals or just appetizers and drinks. As a non-vegan I do have to admit that I'm always skeptical of places like this - very plain/basic menu options weird-tasting dishes due to the substitutes they use or just really odd textures to the food. I was satisfied to see that none of this was true for LOV. Great menu options good taste and very close to just ""normal"" food. The gnocchi in particular was pretty good.Service was good and the ambience of the place was quite nice as well. A very noticeable large entrance on the outside and then a very cozy feel inside. Dim lights close tables and simple decorations/plants all add to an intimate dining experience. If I had to nitpick I would say the lack of a waiting area and the tightness inside are a bit too much (I usually don't like sitting so close to the next table that I could partake in their conversations if I wanted to). The portions were maybe a touch small for a couple dishes and prices a touch high. But again nitpicking here because for vegans to have a place like this to come eat at I could definitely see the appeal in this being a great spot if I was in their position."
Emily M,12/4/2019,3 ,78,279,A solid 3.The decor and ambiance is lovely. The service is great.For the price point the food/drinks are disappointing. Nothing was terrible but also nothing was 'wow'. Some would say the menu is eclectic I would say it's unfocused. From burgers to stir fries to gnocchi to lasagna to poke bowls; it's all over the place.It's trying to be everything and not succeeding in my opinion.Note the description of the chocolate caramel tarte is very misleading. It should be called a coconut caramel crumble with a hint of chocolate. Coconut caramel and crumble are the predominant flavours.
Nadia A,10/19/2019,4 ,120,257,What a light atmosphere this restaurant has. The food was absolutely delicious and rich in flavor. The food wasn't good for a vegan it was good period.Wins: quinoa fritter gnocchi di casa chocolate brownie and my fav the truffles and Caviar The pasta dishes were so good and mouth watering and a decent portion size. The fritters were tasty but small and came with four which seemed a bit stingy to me.Loss: coconut cheesecake and drinksThe cocktails were 14 dollars small and not strong. The cheese cake had a weird texture wasn't creamy and tasted too much like coconut I was happy with the service until the end. I asked to pay part of my bill by card and the rest cash. After I paid for my card portion the waitress told me that the payment I made didn't include tip. I had already planned to provide tip in cash but that's beside the point. There was no reason to point out that I didn't include tip in my transaction. I think it was rude and made me uncomfortable I didn't even want to tip after that comment.
Danielle B,11/24/2019,4 ,212,348,"One of my best friends decided to switch to a vegan lifestyle a couple of years ago. I haven't joined her but I'm more than happy to eat vegan food whenever we're together. We had a (surprisingly) very frustrating time in Vancouver over the summer trying to find restaurants that would satisfy both of our dietary requirements. I never thought it would be so difficult to get a vegan meal in a restaurant so I sympathize with anyone who has similar difficulties when dining out. When I heard about LOV opening up recently I knew I had to take my friend here when she came to visit. It's great knowing that we'd be able to enjoy a meal without her needing to ask about every dish to see if it's vegan or not. We planned on going for an early dinner before her flight so I called ahead to see if we could get a table. It was about 5:30pm at that time and they were fully booked until 7:30pm. Fortunately they had a couple seats at the bar so we sat there. I'll eat almost anything so I told her to order whatever she wanted and I'll share with her.  That way we can try more food! We started with the Beet Tartare served with taro root chips which was absolutely delicious. We also had the Not a Cheese Plate. This dish was a miss for both of us in the sense that it was ok but neither of us would order it again. The ""boursin"" was very watery and lacked flavour and the ""Gorgonzola"" had a strong coconut flavour which wasn't terrible but when something's not meant to taste like coconut it's a bit weird. The ""Gouda"" was the best one of the three with a nice smokey flavour. The crostini was super crunchy and bit difficult to eat but nice with the grilled pepper chutney.For the mains we had the mushroom risotto and the pesto gnocchi. I would order either of those again. I don't know what they use to substitute Parmesan cheese but it was really good. And finally for dessert we shared the chocolate brownie with raspberry sauce. Absolutely delicious and not too sweet. For someone who is non-vegan I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner here. The interior is gorgeous which really elevated the whole dining experience (even the washrooms are pretty!) and the serving staff are lovely. I wouldn't hesitate to go back."
Sugith V,8/30/2020,5 ,44,15,Spectacular room service and most importantly the food. All veg and all delicious. Excellent cocktails. The dumplings and Brussels sprouts were superb starters and mushroom risotto and a squash curry mains and a nicely spicy gnocchi were fab. Heard good things about the bean burger. I'm an omnivore but didn't miss meat. Thank you mgr Lauren (Go Leafs) and waiter Andrew for the hospitality.
Shumona R,9/8/2020,4 ,20,5,Beautiful restaurant and great service. The food portions are quite large but the taste overall is decent. I came here with two friends and we ordered the Mushroom Risotto Dumplings General Tofu and a side of sweet potato fries which was more than we expected. Mushroom Risotto 3/5This was way too creamy and I felt like the peas ruined the dish. Dumplings 4/5Tasty and not too oily. The dipping sauce could have been lighter. I'm not usually a fan of creamy/heavy sauces that go with dumplings.General Tofu 4/5This is delicious and I highly recommend. Sweet Potato Fries 4/5Tastes like any side of fries you would order from a restaurant but the winner here was the vegan mayo. For someone who's a huge carnivore like myself this place is great if you're looking for something new.
Alex I,10/21/2019,4 ,2,130,After a worrying poor experience with 'Shook' the opening of another Vegan restaurant on King West didn't exactly fill me with excitement...BUT this place thankfully was no let down (besides the obvious of not having meat)The food is great not cheap but I line with what you expect and unlike a certain other place the quality and portion sizes are actually outstanding!I'd come back for a lunch again even without meat and their dumplings were great...I'd definitely like to try the soups next timePS - one flaw WHY can't I get normal..actual...proper milk instead of weird almond rubbish.PPS - they have a good alcohol selection too!
Kal-san R,8/16/2020,5 ,47,18,LOV cheeseburger was delicious and coconut curry 10/10  no complaints . The restaurant setting is on king street in the heart of downtown Toronto you can see the busy street life during the day and even night since it's on a busy club scene.
Cynthia W,10/13/2019,4 ,320,170,(4.5/5)I love LOV - a sentiment that I hope all customers will experience. I'm always interested in exploring more of the vegan food scene. LOV is definitely one of those restaurants that has put an immense level of thought into their menu decor and service.Based on aesthetics alone LOV goes above and beyond. There were just so many elements I loved - the foliage the rose gold accents the marble tables and the bright aura. I wish Jacinthe Piotte could design my home.My boyfriend and I arrived around 11:30am on a Sunday - the restaurant was maybe half full so we were seated immediately. They informed us that they were transitioning from brunch to lunch which is definitely earlier than expected. However I believe they were just testing out the brunch menu and will be offering it until 3pm on weekends once it's fully rolled out.We ordered the parsnip &amp; pear toast fennel &amp; mushroom tempura and the king fu burger. I think my favourite was the tempura - both main ingredients paired really well with the breaded exterior which had a great texture. However the sauce tasted too close to..ranch. The dish is advertised to have truffle oil which I struggled to taste. The toast was a great choice - I loved the sweetness of the pears but the bread could have been softer. My date is normally quite passionate about his meats but enjoyed this plant-based burger.With my meal I also ordered the blue lavender latte with oat milk. HIGHLY recommend this drink - there are a variety of flavours and the right level of nuttiness that make it a hearty drink. As a bonus it's incredibly instagrammable. Service was fantastic - we were regularly checked up on by our waiter Andrew. I will 100% be back to try more of their items and hopefully the brunch!
David N,2/29/2020,4 ,43,767,"I'm always a little skeptical when it comes to vegan food mostly because my experiences with it have been less than spectacular. (Planta I'm looking in your direction.)Anyway I'm always up to try a new restaurant so I didn't have to think long when I got an invite for dinner at LOV.The place is definitely quite appealing on a purely aesthetic level but I was more curious about the food obviously.We decided to start with the Not a Cheese Plate (""Feta garlic and chive boursin LOV vegan gorgonzola LOV vegan gouda with grilled pepper chutney mustard sprouts served with crostini""). I can't say I was terribly impressed with any of the options provided. Nothing reminded me in the slightest of cheese as they were all kind of tasteless and often saddled with an unpleasant texture. The crostini was too crunchy as well.At this point my hopes for the main weren't super high. But I was pleasantly surprised when my dish arrived admittedly. I had decided to go with the LOV Lasagna (""Lupini tempeh bolognese sauce with vegan mozzarella and cashew cream served with a side Cesar salad"") and I have to admit if I hadn't known there wasn't any meat or cheese in it I doubt I would've guessed myself.The sauce was surprisingly rich and flavorful while the ""cheese"" topping had a taste that reminded me of a bechamel sauce. The pasta was perhaps a little soggier than I might've preferred but that's a pretty minor complaint for what was otherwise an unexpectedly delicious plate of food.We also decided to share a dessert the Crème Brûlée (""Made from soy and coconut milk""). Though it doesn't even come close to the real thing I actually found this to be quite a tasty and satisfying dessert. The predominant flavor is coconut but it basically works and the sugary torched exterior is exactly the texture and taste it should be.I haven't been to enough vegan restaurants to consider myself an authority but I think LOV probably deserves a place near the top of the list."
Christine X,12/1/2019,2 ,157,104,2 starsI went with my girlfriend on a Saturday night. Very lovely interior clean modern and trendy great for Instagram photos for sure! It was already quite busy when we walked in at 7 pm..To start off we each ordered a cocktail our cocktails came and did not wow us for the price. My drink did not look visually appealing with a snow pea as decoration on it..The best part of our meal? It was the fried dumplings! They were perfectly fried crispy golden brown and filling was flavourful with mushroom and veggies and the almond butter kimchi sauce dip was amazing!We also ordered - Brussel's spouse - 9Brussel sprouts Buffalo sauce fleur de selIt was decent but felt like the sauce made it a little soggy instead of crispy maybe a light drizzle would've been better- King Fu burger - 17Crispy tofu lacto-fermented carrot miso coleslaw spicy sriracha mayoIt was okay  nothing to write home about We also got the Gnocchi Di Casa - 20Buckwheat sweet potato gnocchi in a hemp basil pesto topped with arugula and parmesanWe not a fan of this dish it had a weird after taste. .I also wish the food didn't all come out at the same time. We had to send the mains back because we wanted to finish off the apps first. .I went to use the washroom and thought that it was motion sensor lights for the washroom but nothing went on and there were no switches for it the guy who tried using the unisex washroom next to me seemed confused as well I contemplated  using the washroom in the dark but was glad the guy went and spoke to a server and apparently they forgot to turn on the light .... So all dinner service no one complained about the washroom lights? Odd.....My friend asked for the bill while I was in the washroom I felt like our server was in attentive closer to the end of our meal as I did not get a refill of my water until the bill came. 10 minutes passed and still no bill our server had forgotten and we had to remind her of it. I would've given more stars had the food been better as well as service
