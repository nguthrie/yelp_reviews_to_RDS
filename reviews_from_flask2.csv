Alice L,5/10/2020,5 ,0,5,Went here for Valentine's day. The food was INCREDIBLE. The portion sizes are good as well as the price. The dishes were served at a good pace and are enough to be filling. The drink selection is impeccable. The atmosphere is wonderful there's a great middle ground between being open enough to seem lively yet private enough to be intimate. The staff are nice and very welcoming. 100% recommend going whether it's for date night with friends for brunch or just whenever you want to eat good vegan food.
Ryan L,3/5/2020,4 ,124,91,Came here for dinner tonight.     I didn't have high expectations coming here as I don't usually eat vegan food.   I must say I was pleasantly surprised.   The food here was delicious.Menu options were good good selection to choose from.   I still didn't know what to order but the wait staff was knowledgeable and helped with recommendations.   I ended ordering the grilled eggplant which was $16 (I am not used to paying so much for no meat) but wow it was tasty.    I only wish there was more.   Portion was decent but u should have ordered an app or something to accompany my meal.They have quite a selection of spirits  mock tales and cocktails.  I didn't get one this time around but people at my table seemed to be enjoying them.   I would go back and try something new would not come here on the regular but it was nice for a night out.
Faiza K,1/13/2020,4 ,215,974,Vegan.  Mexican.  Not 2 things I would have necessarily associated with each other but here we are anyways :)Walking into this place it definitely gives off that natural vibe - more towards the back of the restaurant resembles an outdoor garden - lots of plants greens - a great juxtaposition from the dreary and cold winter weather!   Definitely get your IG open and snap away - it's the perfect backdrop to make everyone think you are on some tropical vacation.Came here for brunch and ordered the Jackfruit salad (Jackfruit Sope).  White beans lettuce radishes jackfruit cashew crema and avocado round out this hearty dish.  If you think you are going to leave hungry think again.  It was quite filling.  Having had jackfruit many moons ago this was a good way to get reintroduced to it.  If you didn't tell me it was jackfruit not sure I would be able to tell.The crispness and freshness of the lettuce and radish against the nutty cashew flavour made this a hit for me.And of course..what is brunch without a sweet end note?  So of course churros was ordered for the table.  You get 5 (perfect for sharing or eating all yourself - no judgments here)!Warm crispy and soft inside it was the perfect ending to brunch.Service was good even though it was busy (definitely make reservations).  Easily located on Richmond St W (TTC accessible) but street parking may be hard to come by.
Payal D,10/14/2019,5 ,40,227,This is one of those places that has been on my list of places to try for I don't even know how long and I finally got to do it one afternoon.We have the pre fixe lunch and give us a chance to try a lot of their menu items for a very low price of $23 per person considering the entrees start at $18 it's a steal.Of the two appetizers offered and tried I preferred the chips and guac over the kale salad not just because it's chips and guac but also because the kale felt a little unfinished. I find in a salad unless you have massaged the kale separately it sticks out for me. Next for our mains we tried the chorizo bowl and the other I can't recall the name of!! Both were equally delicious and if you're a spice person definitely try out their house-made hot sauces..I had to actively stop myself from wanting to pick those bottles up and bringing them home!! I'm kidding of course ...And the star of the meal for me were their churros I don't know if it's common or normal to have coconut in them but wow! I wasn't so blown away by the mousse.... But frankly it's the truth that blew the mousse out of the competition!! The other aspect of it which I must mention is the overall decor. The interiors are really beautiful and yes I know those plants are fake for the most part but on a chilly day that's side really brightens up your mood.We will definitely be back for more meals here.
Jazz L,7/18/2019,4 ,182,139,ROSALINDA was has vegan Mexican food! I'm generally a meat-eater but this place was GREAT! Everything we tried was tasty there was a large variety of dishes and they had many interesting ways of creating traditional dishes with plant based products instead of meat. Coconut Ceviche:  Very refreshing and has a nice amount of citrus (not too acidic but citrusy enough) and the coconut was very fresh. I still prefer seafood ceviche though. Jackfruit taco: Very flavourful and the texture of the jackfruit was meaty but smooth.Eggplant with peanuts cashew cream promegranate and sunflower seeds: I love eggplant and how it soaks up all the flavours it's cooked in! Broccolini: Very good and flavourful.POTATO AND MUSHROOM FLAUTAS: THE SHOW-STOPPER!  It's a yummy potato mushroom mixture in a crispy rolled tortilla... Definitely my favorite dish!
Claudia K,6/19/2019,3 ,64,99,"First off I made reservations at this restaurant because it was within walking distance of the Princess Alexandra and it was two nights before a Friday night musical that I was going to see. I do blame myself for not having made reservations sooner in advance so that I'd have more options to choose from. This place looks beautiful with all of its plants and open space concept it has going on. The service we received at this restaurant was great! Our waiter seemed to love working here and was extremely friendly at every point during the meal! There are indeed more than a few drawbacks here though....SEATING! I had made a reservation for a table for two. I believe we ended up being seated within a row of 5 other tables that were also for tables of two..... It was extremely uncomfortable having the tables so close together. The distance between our table and the ones next to ours was probably only 6 to 8 inches at the most. This made it really awkward to get in and out of our table when we needed to go use the bathroom or just get into our seats. FOOD! [Veggie Fritters] $8 - came with 5 fritters and a tamarind-ancho dip! I'm not sure if this is how it's supposed to taste but the dip had a bitter flavor which was off-putting. I think the lime that they provided really helped take the edge off of it after I squeezed the living crap out of it to aid in the flavor! The fritters themselves were made out of what might have been a carrot/sweet potato combination. I'm not sure what this dish is supposed to be like texture/taste wise but the exterior of each fritter was too overcooked and the interior of each one had a powdery texture to it. It was extremely odd. Suffice to say I was not a fan of this dish [ROSABURGER] $18 - this burger was recommended by Yelpers who claimed that the rest of the menu primarily consisted of small dishes that weren't that filling. Upon reading that I passed this information along to my boyfriend so he ordered the Rosaburger as it comes with a side of fries! I'm going to be perfectly honest and say that I did not enjoy the burger at all. I asked him how he was liking it during the meal and he responded with ""it's alright"" or something along the lines of that. I would say that ""alright"" is an extremely misleading remark as I'm not really sure what happened to the dishes we ordered that day but everything sort of tasted like a sprinkle of dirt had been tossed in for extra flavor. THE FRIES WERE THE SAVING GRACE THOUGH AS THEY WERE PERFECTLY CRISPY AND FLAVORFUL! [CARROT COLADA] $14 - this drink was made out of the following as per their menu: novo fogo cachaca cocchi americano giffard banane du bresil lime pineapple carrot and blood orange. The catchphrase they have for this drink is ""Earthy tropical and a touch of funk"". I would say that they definitely nailed the EARTHY aspect of this drink and that was pretty much it.... Sufficed to say I did not enjoy this either unfortunately. NOW I'm usually the kind to judge based on a thorough visit of a restaurant BUT one of my colleagues at work dined here a week after I did and said the food was phenomenal. Given the experience I just detailed I was extremely skeptical and questioning of her experience. It seems that I ordered all of the things she did not order so I may have to stop by just one more time to see if she's spewing lies or truths....."
Joyce L,6/2/2019,4 ,187,440,Rosalinda is an innovative vegan Mexican restaurant in the heart of the financial district in downtown Toronto. The decor is instagram worthy with green plants and stylized furniture. Staff are helpful in providing recommendations.I had the salsify with persimmon carrot purée and peanuts. It is also known as the oyster plant ($17). The plate is definitely on the smaller end. The chef made a substitute for the chimichurri as there were ingredients in it that I cannot have. Overall it was still a great dish. I love the balance of sweet and savoury between the creamy texture of the carrot purée and the persimmon slices. The triple chocolate mousse ($8) with coconut-date crumble toasted buckwheat and dulce de coco was great as well. It was a great vegans dessert. The texture of the crumble played off the mousse very well. Overall I had a very positive experience at Rosalina. I will definitely be back to sample other dishes!
Stefania M,5/19/2019,4 ,59,38,We came here for my birthday with a group of 10 people out of which I am the only veggie. The restaurant is very aesthetically pleasing greenhouse-like and covered in greenery. For groups they offer a family style dinning option where you are served 8 different dishes (enough to feed your whole group so for us we got about 3-4 plates of each dish) for $30 a person. You can up the cost per person if you want to be served more but it was PLENTY. I would highly recommend this option if you come so that you can experience the most items on the menu for the best price. Everything for the most part was so good!! The tacos unfortunately were the dishes I didn't appreciate the most. I feel like a lot of the time with vegan restaurants they try to one-up a traditionally meat oriented dish when it would be perfectly fine if they were to just substitute the meat for something else. We found the flavours were too complicated and unlike a traditional taco. This threw off a lot of us especially since I am the only plant based person in my group. The desserts were THE BEST PART. I don't even have much to say about it because it was just that good. We were served a chocolate mousse a mango cake with coconut whipped cream and churros. AMAZING. Overall we were all stuffed to content. All my meat eater friends were satisfied. I was satisfied. It was a great experience.
Sabina B,6/1/2019,2 ,19,75,"This spot is a vegan Mexican restaurant with really cute decor and a nice atmosphere. The entire place is light walls colourful seats and booths and tons of greenery. I would describe this restaurant as ""earthy"". I ordered the chorizo quinoa bowl and was not impressed. Apart from quinoa broccoli zucchini and arugula there wasn't much else in this bowl. The taste was incredibly bland and dry. The best part of the bowl was the grilled zucchini but there were only two pieces of it. I could have definitely crafted a tastier (and cheaper) quinoa bowl at home. The service was good and our server made sure to bring a candle in the churros for the birthday girl. He came by to refill our waters and check in on us periodically throughout the night. He also offered to take a group picture of us which I thought was nice."
Kat J,5/22/2019,5 ,20,197,Full disclosure I only got a cocktail here and the bartender was sweet enough to also get me a guacamole and tortillas.This was such a great experience I was seated right away the bartender came over very quickly and the barn when you had some fabulous cocktails with such interesting and unique ingredients. The bartender help me make my decision by give me some pros and cons for a couple of cocktails depending on my likes. I ended up getting the Del Sol which had a ton of really interesting ingredients as well including things like st Germain kombucha hibiscus. Dominic was my bartender and we was attentive but also let me do my own thing. I only had the guac so I can't give you the full review but what I tried was lovely and the staff were fantastic!
Annie C,2/8/2020,3 ,585,9,Got the winterlicious menu. 3 stars due to mediocre service and food. Best part of this restaurant is the interior design. Windows in the back tint into a mirror at night live plants everywhere comfy booths and tables. I went after sunset so couldn't see the whole greenhouse effect but I'm sure it's bright and beautiful throughout the day. Food-wise I've had better vegan food. - The app came with chips (doesn't say on the menu!!!). The chips were too tough and thick and hard to chew. Chip to ceviche ratio was too high. - Entree only came with two tortilla wraps way too little compared to the larger portion of mole and sun chokes. - Churro dessert was more of a cake with ice cream on top. The texture was gummy and tough--although props on having a vegan churro dish on the menu. Service was slow had to wait 20 min for the bill to come after asking multiple times.Overall good vegan option to try and a great environment to chat over food but won't be craving for the food here.
Tania L,3/10/2019,3 ,231,417,This review would've received a 2.5 star for the food but the service was pretty good. Chantele is one of the best waitresses! She was very friendly and easy to chat to and decently attentive enough given that the restaurant was packed on the Friday night we went. Based off Chantele's recommendations we got the multigrain chicharron ($9) to share. It's honestly just your typical multigrain chips served with a small side of guacamole and a red sisil pak made with serrano and ancho. There was NOT enough dip for the chips and we were disappointed when we quickly ran out of the chunky guacamole. The other dip was interesting; it was fairly spicy with a grainy texture. Having heard my fellow Yelpers I knew in advance that the portions would be small and therefore recommended to my friends to order the Rosa burger ($18) if they wanted to be full. Indeed the burger was the most filling item on the menu; it came with a bunch of fries on the side and was pretty hefty. My friend who had the burger said that it was a pretty solid vegan burger. That said I thought the fries were quite mediocre... they were limp and soft. Around three of my friends ordered the tofu and rice bowl ($17) - one loved it but the other two were unimpressed. Apparently it was just a mishmash of various items and lacked in seasoning and flavour. The other friend who ordered the taco just picked at it... A couple of my friends then ordered the tres leches cake and greatly enjoyed it!As I had ate most of the chicharron I wasn't hungry - as such I ordered the seasonal salad. Priced at $14 you'd think it'd be a decent serving size - but the salad was so small that it could fit into the palm of my hand. The plate was nicely presented (the avocado artistically draped over the small arugula bits with a drizzle of the avo-sesame vinaigrette and the pomegranate and chickpeas added a pop of colour) and the taste was okay but it was truly unfulfilling.Though Rosalinda is very instagrammable and aesthetically pleasing the food is truly underwhelming and overpriced. Likely won't come again!
Karishma M,3/23/2019,4 ,381,110,We got flautas chilaquiles tacos and the tres leches cake.The flautas (which was my order and I really enjoyed) and tacos were good. Chilaquiles (which we shared) were not as good as the flautas and tacos. We had mixed feelings about the tres leches cake. The pineapple in it was really strong so we ended up not liking it. We removed the pineapple for some bites and then it was better but it's kind of like a standard cake at that point.Based on the prior reviews I thought Rosalinda was going to be bad but as American vegans visiting Toronto I wanted to at least try it. It was definitely not bad. I think it matches up to the other reviews in that some dishes are better than others and you can correspondingly have a hit or miss experience.
David Y,8/7/2019,3 ,193,223,As we went on our date with Rosalinda my wife and I had dreams of this being a lifelong relationship. We had high hopes - she was after all an absolute stunner with her gorgeous interiors (cool architecture clean lines bright vibe) and great service. But as we engaged with her more I guess we just didn't click with what was most important to us - the food! We came here for lunch and got:- Guac and chips: Pretty good. The guac was nice and creamy though portion size was a bit small. The chips were pretty standard.- Rosaburger: I've seen a lot of hype for this burger and frankly I prefer the ones at Planta and Fresh. It wasn't bad it just wasn't the best vegan/vegetarian one I've had. Upgraded to the  fry supreme for my side which was awesome (the cashew crema on it was really good).- Chorizo Quinoa Bowl: This was the biggest disappointment as there just wasn't a lot of taste and contrasting flavours in this dish.- Spicey Churros: Good fry decent size. And the side dulce de coco was a nice approximation of dulce de leche.- Chocolate Mousse: The cocount-date crumble added a nice texture to this standard mousse.Rosalinda was pleasant yet forgettable. I can see why others would fall in love with her. Unfortunately she just wants our type.
Ashley Y,1/23/2019,3 ,24,95,"I love trying vegan restaurants to see how they measure up to their non-vegan counterparts but this restaurant just didn't do it for me. Paid $35 for 5 dishes split with a friend and found these are way too overpriced. Normally you have to eat a bit more if you're ordering vegan to get your protein and fibre in but the portions here were TINY. One thing I did enjoy was the atmosphere - it felt like sitting in a zen greenhouse!VEGGIE FRITTERS (4/5): Loved the flavour of these; they reminded me of indian veggie pakora but made out of sweet potato and broccoli. You get 5 tator tot sized fritters with some sort of thick bean paste to dip them in. CHORIZO ROJO TACO (3/5): My fave part was the black bean tortilla. The filling tasted like a combo of lentils and bean with some sort of salsa verde sauce. Not my fave dish of the evening. JACKFRUIT PIBIL TACO (3/5): Loved the flavour of the actual jackfruit but I felt the majority of the taco was fluffed up with the slaw (i think radish) and taro chips. ROASTED EGGPLANT (3.5/5): These were good but portion was tiny - you get three small eggplant halves. Most flavourful dish so far but didn't think the chopped peanuts went well with the dish. TRES LECHES CAKE (4.5/5): Absolutely worth ordering!! The coconut cream topped with more coconut chips was so delicious that I was basically licking off the plate. Nothing special about the cake and I thought the ""leches"" sauce tasted a bit too fake from the real deal although the grilled pineapple was a nice touch if you mix it in with the sauce. Don't think I'll be back there's other vegan restaurants in the city better off with your money."
Janna S,7/16/2019,5 ,176,576,A friend recently introduced me to Rosalinda and I'm already plotting a return. Although I'm not vegan or vegetarian I will happily opt for those menu choices when the food is prepared by talented chefs since these types of dishes are labour intensive and require advanced prep and experience. The service was excellent throughout our meal with plenty of attention accommodating dietary restrictions and food intolerances.My favourite item was from their sharing menu CHILAQUILES VERDES with crispy tortilla avocado jalapeno kale cashew crema and queso. WOW! I actually had to pause after the first bite and simply appreciate how delicious this was. Also tried their avocado tostadas and chorizo tacos and I did not leave disappointed. Prices are about what you'd expect for this area but it's such a treat! Their mocktail game is strong but you will pay cocktail prices. Bathrooms were very clean and I appreciate the funky décor continuity.
Valerie Q,2/23/2020,5 ,25,18,I don't know what was better... the food or service. We had to sit at the bar because it was busy. The bartender was very helpful and really nice. We were there on a Saturday evening. They suggested items and they were a hit. Food was delicious. The green salsa brought me back to Mexico. I didn't miss meat at all. If I could always eat this food I'd definitely become a vegan. The overall vibe was great too.
Brianna P,2/13/2020,5 ,4,10,This place is a must try for vegans!  There are not many vegan spots that have amazing vegan food with lots of flavour and options and this place had it all!  The food was fresh tasty and clean.  There were so many options with a Mexican modern vibe fusion feel.  The restaurant is super cute with a relaxing inviting airy atmosphere.  It's the perfect date spot or business meeting location because of cool calm environment.  They use reusable straws which I haven't seen in many restaurants yet.  Must try!
Sharon Y,6/2/2019,4 ,76,21,"First off the decor in this place is absolutely gorgeous. Totally instagrammable if you care about stuff like that.My friends and I came here for brunch on a Saturday. We booked a table in advance but I don't think that's necessary because there were plenty of empty seats when we got there.The waitstaff are patient and friendly and they checked in on us often to help us refill waters and such. We took a long time to place our order because we were waiting for our full party to arrive and they were very kind about it. The food itself was reasonably priced (most things around $12-$15). In fact my friends and I were quite surprised at how low the prices were given the location in the financial district and how nice the restaurant was. My friends and I ordered a variety of dishes that were all ""decently good"". I'm not a vegan so I will say that it's good for a healthy meal but it does lack the greasy heartiness of your regular brunch options (whether or not this is a plus is up to you).I ordered the Chilaquiles Verdes ($15) and it came as fried tortilla chips with various sauces and a mystery meat substitute. My friends and I agreed that we couldn't quite place what the meat substitute was or what the flavour of the dish could be considered but we thought it was tasty nonetheless. Nothing to call home about but it was my favourite dish of the table.For dessert we shared the spiced churros ($8). They came as a stack of 6 mini churros with a chocolate dipping sauce. I personally didn't really like this dish because the churros were very dense and heavy unlike the light and crisp texture you'd expect. The chocolate sauce also tasted a bit off. I'd probably skip this one.Overall the food was just okay but everything else about the restaurant (price decor and service) made up for it. If I'm feeling healthy or I need an Instagram pic I'll probably come back. Not the tastiest vegan food I've had but also not the worst."
Celine D,12/28/2019,5 ,89,23,Wow! My friend and I have been to most of the vegan restaurants downtown and Rosalinda was one of our top favourites. I was craving some Mexican food so we decided to try it out. The restaurant itself isn't in a busy location so it was a nice quiet brunch spot. The brunch menu had a decent selection and I decided on the chilaquiles as I've never tried the dish before. They came with a cashew queso avocado jalapenos and a vegan chorizo mix. I tried some of my friend's enchiladas and the flavours were super bold and delicious. For the portion size the prices were very fair and service was great. I'd definitely come back to try their regular menu!
